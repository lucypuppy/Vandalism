/**
 * Represents a color in the HSB color space. This class is used to store colors in a more convenient way.
 * <p>
 * The HSB color space is a color space that describes colors in terms of hue, saturation, and brightness (also
 * called value). It is a nonlinear transformation of the RGB color space. The HSB color space is often used in
 * color selection tools, such as in Photoshop.
 * <br>
 * The HSB color space can be visualized as a double cone with the primary colors red, green, and blue at the
 * vertices of the triangle at the bottom. The brightness is represented by the vertical axis. The hue is the
 * angle of the vector from the origin to the point on the cone. The saturation is the distance from the origin.
